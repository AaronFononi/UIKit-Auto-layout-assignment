Project Overview

This project features a calculator UI, implemented to gain deeper experience with Auto Layout in Xcode’s Interface Builder. The app’s layout adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, showcasing the effectiveness of well-defined constraints.

Learning Objectives

	•	Understanding Auto Layout principles to create responsive layouts.
	•	Mastery of constraints for aligning, spacing, and resizing UI elements.
	•	Familiarity with UIKit components such as buttons, labels, and views, and setting them up in Interface Builder.

Technologies Used

	•	UIKit: For building the user interface.
	•	Auto Layout: To create flexible layouts that adjust to different devices and orientations.
	•	Interface Builder (Xcode): For visually designing the UI and adding constraints.

Key Features

	•	A complete calculator UI created using Auto Layout.
	•	Dynamic and adaptive layout that scales across different screen sizes and orientations.
	•	Properly defined constraints for all buttons and display areas, without any functional logic.
